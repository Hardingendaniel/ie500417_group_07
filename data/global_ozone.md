#### Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, Remote European Sensing Satellite, Germany
- During the Arctic Winter of 1995/96, the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment on the ERS-2 satellite was the only instrument measuring total ozone on a near-global scale. Extremely low ozone levels were observed in February and March within the Arctic vortex. <sup>[2]</sup>
- Low ozone levels can affect temperatures because when the ozone layer is depleted, it leads to cooling in the stratosphere. With less ozone, there is less absorption of UV radiation, which results in cooler stratospheric temperatures. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, which heats the stratosphere. Therefore, with low levels of ozone, less heat is added to the stratosphere.  <sup>[5]</sup>
