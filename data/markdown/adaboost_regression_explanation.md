# AdaBoost Regression

**AdaBoost Regression** 
is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to 
create a strong predictive model. By focusing sequentially on the errors of previous models, AdaBoost enhances overall 
forecasting accuracy. In this model it used Decision Trees as the base estimator.

## **Why AdaBoost Regression?**
- **Boosting Capability:** Enhances model performance by sequentially focusing on errors from previous iterations.
- **Robustness:** Reduces overfitting and improves generalization, ensuring reliable forecasts.
- **Versatility:** Capable of modeling complex patterns in data, making it suitable for diverse emission trajectories.

By incorporating AdaBoost Regression, we get the strengths of ensemble learning to deliver accurate and resilient 
forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions, capturing complicated emission behaviors across Europe.
