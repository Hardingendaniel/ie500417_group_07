# ARIMA Model

The **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model is a powerful time series forecasting tool that 
captures various temporal structures in data. 

## **Why ARIMA?**
- **Temporal Dependencies:** ARIMA effectively models data with trends and seasonality by combining autoregressive and 
- moving average components.
- **Flexibility:** Suitable for non-stationary data, as it incorporates differencing to achieve stationarity.
- **Accuracy:** Provides reliable short-term forecasts, making it ideal for predicting annual greenhouse gas 
- emissions based on historical trends.

By leveraging ARIMA, we aim to capture the underlying patterns in Europe's GHG emissions data, enabling accurate future projections.
