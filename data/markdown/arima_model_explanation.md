# ARIMA Model

The **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** 
The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a powerful 
statistical tool used for time series forecasting. It analyzes and models 
time-dependent data by incorporating aspects of autoregression (AR), differencing 
(integration, I), and moving average (MA).

In the context of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, the ARIMA model is effective 
for capturing underlying patterns and trends in historical data, even amidst disruptions 
like the COVID-19 pandemic. By understanding past emissions, ARIMA helps in forecasting future trends

## **Key Components of ARIMA**
- **Autoregression (AR):** Utilizes the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations 
- (past values) to model the time series.
- **Integration (I):** Involves differencing the data to achieve stationarity, removing trends or seasonality 
- to stabilize the mean of the time series.
- **Moving Average (MA):**  Models the relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model 
- applied to lagged observations.

By using the ARIMA model, we aim to accurately forecast Europe's greenhouse gas emissions by capturing temporal dependencies 
and trends inherent in the data.
