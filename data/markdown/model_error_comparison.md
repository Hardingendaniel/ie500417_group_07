# Model Error Comparison

This bar chart compares the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** of four forecasting models used to predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Europe. 
MSE quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the actual data, with lower values indicating better model performance.

### Models Evaluated:
- **ARIMA (Blue)**:
  - Demonstrates the lowest error among the models, indicating strong predictive accuracy for the dataset.
- **Exponential Smoothing (Red)**:
  - Performs better than Polynomial Regression and AdaBoost, with moderate error values.
- **Polynomial Regression (Green)**:
  - Shows higher error levels, suggesting it may struggle to fit the trends in the data effectively.
- **AdaBoost (Purple)**:
  - Produces the highest error, indicating less suitability for this dataset compared to other methods.

### Insights:
- **ARIMA** is the most accurate model, suggesting it effectively captures the trends in historical data.
- **Exponential Smoothing** also performs reasonably well, benefiting from its ability to adapt to variations.
- **Polynomial Regression** and **AdaBoost** show significantly higher errors, highlighting limitations in their applicability for this dataset.

### Notes:
- Error is displayed on the y-axis in MSE units.
- These results can guide model selection for future forecasting tasks, prioritizing accuracy and interpretability.
