**Greenhouse gases** (shortened to GHG) are the gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases let through sunlight, but prevents some of the heat from leaving the atmosphere. This effect is called "The Greenhouse Effect", the effect happens when GHGs collect in the atmosphere, while they naturally occur, human activities contribute to abnormally increasing the gases in the atmosphere. GHGs act as an insulator, keeping the climate on Earth comfortable. However, an increase of the GHGs leads to warmer temperatures, as the gases trap more of the heat than they should. This leads to global warming. <sup>[1]</sup>

**Below** is a graph showing the 3 different greenhouse gases, and how much of each type in % each gas makes up of the total GHG released. <sup>[2]</sup>
