# Polynomial Regression

**Polynomial Regression** extends linear regression by modeling the relationship between the independent variable 
and the target degree polynomial.

## **Why Polynomial Regression?**
- **Non-Linearity:** Captures complex, non-linear relationships in emission trends that linear models might miss.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for the fitting of curves that can better represent fluctuations and inflection points in the data.
- **Enhanced Fit:** Improves the accuracy of forecasts by adapting to the curvature in historical emission data.

Implementing Polynomial Regression enables a more nuanced understanding of emission dynamics, facilitating precise 
forecasts that account for underlying non-linear trends in Europe's greenhouse gas emissions.
