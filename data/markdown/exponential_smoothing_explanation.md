# Exponential Smoothing

**Exponential Smoothing** is a versatile forecasting method that applies weighted averages to past observations, 
with weights decreasing exponentially over time.

## **Why Exponential Smoothing?**
- **Adaptability:** Capable of modeling data with trends by incorporating additive or multiplicative components.
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and interpret, making it accessible for stakeholders.
- **Responsive:** Quickly adjusts to changes in data patterns, ensuring forecasts remain relevant as emission trends evolve.

Utilizing Exponential Smoothing allows us to generate smooth and responsive forecasts of Europe's 
greenhouse gas emissions, reflecting both historical performance and recent changes.
