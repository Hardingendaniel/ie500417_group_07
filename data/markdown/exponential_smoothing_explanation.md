# Exponential Smoothing

**Exponential Smoothing** 
Exponential Smoothing is a versatile forecasting method that applies exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. 
This technique is effective for data exhibiting trends but lacking strong seasonal patterns.

## **Why Exponential Smoothing?**
- **Adaptability:** Capable of modeling data with trends by incorporating additive or multiplicative components.
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and interpret, making it accessible for stakeholders.
- **Responsive:** Quickly adjusts to changes in data patterns, ensuring forecasts remain relevant as emission trends evolve.

In forecasting Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, Exponential Smoothing allows us to generate smooth and adaptive predictions 
that reflect both historical performance and recent changes, providing valuable insights for future environmental strategies.
