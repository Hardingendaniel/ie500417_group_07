# Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions Forecast Comparison

This graph presents the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for European countries from 1990 to 2020, 
along with forecasts extending into future years using three different forecasting methods: ARIMA, Exponential 
Smoothing, and AdaBoost Regression. The visualization includes both historical emissions data and model-generated forecasts,
providing a comprehensive view of past trends and future projections.

### Key Features:
- **BLue Line:** Actual GHG emissions data for Europe from 1990 to 2020.
  - **ARIMA Future Forecast:** Shows the ARIMA model's forecasted GHG emissions for future years.
  - **Exponential Smoothing Future Forecast:** Shows the Exponential Smoothing model's forecasted GHG emissions for future years.
  - **AdaBoost Future Forecast:** Shows the AdaBoost model's forecasted GHG emissions for future years.


### Insights:
- **Historical Trends:** The historical emissions data shows a gradual decline in total GHG emissions since the 1990s.
- **Model Predictions:** Forecasting models predict further decreases in emissions, with slight variation in the rate of decline depending on the methodology.
- **Comparative Analysis:** By displaying all models together, we can compare their forecasts, assessing which models align more closely with historical trends and each other.
- 
### Notes:
- **Future Uncertainty:** While future forecasts provide valuable insights, they are subject to uncertainties, especially considering potential 
policy changes, technological advancements, or unforeseen events affecting emissions.
