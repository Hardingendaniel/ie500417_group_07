# Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions Forecast Comparison

This graph illustrates the **total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions forecast** for European countries from 1990 to 2022, alongside predictions for future years using various forecasting methods. The data includes both historical actual emissions and modeled forecasts using ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Polynomial Regression, and AdaBoost.

### Key Features:
- **Red Line**: Historical GHG emissions data for Europe.
- **Blue Dashed Line**: ARIMA forecast for future GHG emissions.
- **Yellow Dotted Line**: Exponential Smoothing forecast for future GHG emissions.
- **Green Dashed Line**: Polynomial Regression forecast.
- **Purple Dotted Line**: AdaBoost forecast model.

### Additional Data:
- **Orange Line (Secondary Y-Axis)**: Total European GHG emissions, aggregated across all european countries from another dataset that has data after 2020. 
- This allows for comparison of model predictions.

### Insights:
- The historical emissions data shows a gradual decline in total GHG emissions since the 1990s.
- Forecasting models predict further decreases in emissions, with slight variation in the rate of decline depending on the methodology.
- The orange line highlights the overall aggregated trend of emissions in Europe, which aligns closely with the historical data and forecasts.

### Notes:
- The secondary y-axis (on the right) shows the total European GHG emissions scale for better visualization of aggregated data.
