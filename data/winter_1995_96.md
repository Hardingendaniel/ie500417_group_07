- 1995-96 winter season (December to February) had unusual weather patterns throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Countries most effected were Canada, Scandinavia, Russia, Greenland and Northern parts of the USA. December of 1995 and February of 1996 were abnormally cold.
- The arctic winter of 95/96 received significant attention, especially due to the higher amount of energy required to produce heat in the affected countries <sup>[6]</sup>, which lead to higher greenhouse gas emission, which can be observed in the bottom graph. <sup>[3]</sup>
- A significantly contributing factor for this is that during the 1994/95 year, the La Ni単a phenomonem was active, and the following year El Ni単o occured. El Ni単o is the phase that is characterized by warmer than average sea-surface temperature, which occurs when trade winds weaken. While La Ni単a is the opposite, with cooler-than-average sea surface temperature. These patterns can lead to either warmer or colder winters, especially in North America. <sup>[4]</sup>
