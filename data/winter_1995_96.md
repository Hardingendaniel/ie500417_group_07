### Arctic Winter of 1995/96

#### National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), US Government
- 1995-96 winter season (December to February) had unusual weather patterns throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Countries most effected were Canada, Scandinavia, Russia, Greenland and Northern parts of the USA. December of 1995 and February of 1996 were abnormally cold.
- These unusual patterns were in many ways the opposite of the observed 94/95 winter, which can be observed at the start of 95, especially in February, when it was abnormally warm compapared to February of the 96, where the arctic winter took place. <sup>[1]</sup>
- The arctic winter of 95/96 received significant attention, especially due to the higher amount of energy required to produce heat in the affected countries, which lead to higher greenhouse gas emission, which can be observed in the bottom graph. <sup>[3]</sup>
- A significantly contributing factor for this is that during the 1994/95 year, the La Niña phenomonem was active, and the following year El Niño occured. El Niño is the phase that is characterized by warmer than average sea-surface temperature, which occurs when trade winds weaken. While La Niña is the opposite, with cooler-than-average sea surface temperature. These patterns can lead to either warmer or colder winters, especially in North America. <sup>[4]</sup>
- While the 1993/94 winter was also very cold, it didn't have the same combination of ozone depletion, severity and duration.


#### Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, Remote European Sensing Satellite, Germany
- During the Arctic Winter of 1995/96, the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment on the ERS-2 satellite was the only instrument measuring total ozone on a near-global scale. Extremely low ozone levels were observed in February and March within the Arctic vortex. <sup>[2]</sup>
- Low ozone levels can affect temperatures because when the ozone layer is depleted, it leads to cooling in the stratosphere. With less ozone, there is less absorption of UV radiation, which results in cooler stratospheric temperatures. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, which heats the stratosphere. Therefore, with low levels of ozone, less heat is added to the stratosphere.  <sup>[5]</sup>
